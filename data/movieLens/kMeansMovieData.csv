3405,"Night to Remember, A (1958)",Action|Drama,A successful attempt at an even-handed portrayal of the White Star Line's (later part of Cunard) luxury liner R.M.S. Titanic's sinking from the standpoint of 2nd Officer Charles Herbert Lightoller himself the most senior of the ill-fated ship's Deck Officers to survive the disaster. (Lightoller later went on to distinguish himself as a line British Naval Officer during the First World War and served as a Senior Naval Staff Officer (convoys) during WWII. Between wars he owned and operated a successful family business producing pleasure craft.) His own survival of the sinking along with several others is shown atop one of the liner's two "collapsible" lifeboats which was capsized in floating off the liner as it sank. The picture depicts then known facts (c1958) as reported after the sinking; such as the woeful lack of adequate lifeboats the ship's band playing true to the very end White Star's co-owner Bruce Ismay's somewhat less than chivalrous departure from the sinking vessel -and- the Titanic's designer (Andrews on-board) revelation that due to the severity of below-the-water-line damage and that the vaunted watertight compartments were not designed to nor sealed up to the weather deck would only delay the inevitable as sea water spilled over the top of one to the next from the bows to the stern. It also addresses the mysterious ship seen from the Titanic's bridge stopped some 12-19 miles off and depicts it as being the S.S. Californian whom - if that steamship had responded the loss of life could have been far far less. The Californian is seen stopped due to the ice warnings the same alerts whose import were undervalued by the Titanic's Captain Smith. She herself had shut-down wireless operations nominally at 11:00pm as her sole operator retired for the evening this before the iceberg was struck and the 1st distress calls were made by Titanic. It also addresses somewhat the coal fire in one of Titanic's bunkers - apparently not uncommon back in those days before her departure into the Atlantic and potential for damage to steel plates below the water line. (This picture predates the calling-into-question of the quality of rivets (metalurgy) which has since come to the fore.) The film also shows the class distinction and its impact as to whom - of the "women and children first" got a seat in a boat; the fact that the first/earliest lifeboats launched were not at full capacity; and that the boats launched from the port and starboard side held to different criteria as to loading. The latter allows the viewer an inference as to the importance for crew and passenger alike as to lifeboat drills which were then (1912) neither required nor ever held aboard Titanic. One of several movies on the subject it stands well the test-of-time for its "just the facts" approach in the telling and avoidance of conjecture or added melodrama.

That case is defending American war veteran Leonard Vole a poor out of work struggling inventor who is accused of murdering his fifty-six year old lonely and wealthy widowed acquaintance Emily French.

"If ever a child needed kin it's now" one lady says. With no knowledge of who her father is Addie's only haven is her Aunt's home in St. Joseph Missouri. Having identified himself as a "traveling man spreading the Lord's gospel in these troubled times" "Mose" is prevailed upon to deliver the helpless child to her Aunt since he's going that way anyway.

27322,Paragraph 175 (2000),Documentary,By the 1920's Berlin had become known as a homosexual eden where gay men and lesbians lived relatively open lives amidst an exciting subculture of artists and intellectuals. With the coming to power of the Nazis all this changed. Between 1933 and 1945 100000 men were arrested for homosexuality under Paragraph 175 the sodomy provision of the German penal code dating back to 1871. Some were imprisoned others were sent to concentration camps. Of the latter only about 4000 survived. Today fewer than ten of these men are known to be living. Five of them have now come forward to tell their stories for the first time in this powerful new film. The Nazi persecution of homosexuals may be the last untold story of the Third Reich. Paragraph 175 fills a crucial gap in the historical record and reveals the lasting consequences of this hidden chapter of 20th century history as told through personal stories of men and women who lived through it: the half Jewish gay resistance fighter who spent the war helping refugees in Berlin; the Jewish lesbian who escaped to England with the help of a woman she had a crush on; the German Christian photographer who was arrested and imprisoned for homosexuality then joined the army on his release because he "wanted to be with men"; the French Alsatian teenager who watched as his lover was tortured and murdered in the camps. These are stories of survivors -- sometimes bitter but just as often filled with irony and humor; tortured by their memories yet infused with a powerful will to endure. Their moving testimonies rendered with evocative images of their lives and times tell a haunting compelling story of human resilience in the face of unspeakable cruelty. Intimate in its portrayals sweeping in its implications Paragraph 175 raises provocative questions about memory history and identity.

Serving as presenter and guide is the charismatic Slavoj Zizek acclaimed philosopher and psychoanalyst. With his engaging and passionate approach to thinking Zizek delves into the hidden language of cinema uncovering what movies can tell us about ourselves. Whether he is untangling the famously baffling films of David Lynch or overturning everything you thought you knew about Hitchcock Zizek illuminates the screen with his passion intellect and unfailing sense of humour. THE PERVERT'S GUIDE TO CINEMA cuts its cloth from the very world of the movies it discusses; by shooting at original locations and from replica sets it creates the uncanny illusion that Zizek is speaking from 'within' the films themselves. Together the three parts construct a compelling dialectic of ideas. Described by The Times in London as 'the woman helming this Freudian inquest' director Sophie Fiennes' collaboration with Slavoj Zizek illustrates the immediacy with which film and television can communicate complex ideas. Says Zizek: 'My big obsession is to make things clear. I can really explain a line of thought if I can somehow illustrate it in a scene from a film. THE PERVERT'S GUIDE TO CINEMA is really about what psychoanalysis can tell us about cinema.'

The production of food overall has more drastically changed since that time than the several thousand years prior. Controlled primarily by a handful of multinational corporations the global food production business - with an emphasis on the business - has as its unwritten goals production of large quantities of food at low direct inputs (most often subsidized) resulting in enormous profits which in turn results in greater control of the global supply of food sources within these few companies. Health and safety (of the food itself of the animals produced themselves of the workers on the assembly lines and of the consumers actually eating the food) are often overlooked by the companies and are often overlooked by government in an effort to provide cheap food regardless of these negative consequences. Many of the changes are based on advancements in science and technology but often have negative side effects.The products made have been shown in several studies to enlarge male sexual organs and increase male breast size. The answer that the companies have come up with is to throw more science at the problems to bandage the issues but not the root causes. The global food supply may be in crisis with lack of biodiversity but can be changed on the demand side of the equation.

89337,"Interrupters, The (2011)",Documentary,The Interrupters tells the moving and surprising stories of three Violence Interrupters who try to protect their Chicago communities from the violence they once employed. From acclaimed director Steve James and bestselling author Alex Kotlowitz this film is an unusually intimate journey into the stubborn persistence of violence in our cities. Shot over the course of a year out of Kartemquin Films The Interrupters captures a period in Chicago when it became a national symbol for the violence in our cities. During that period the city was besieged by high-profile incidents most notably the brutal beating of Derrion Albert a Chicago High School student whose death was caught on videotape. The film's main subjects work for an innovative organization CeaseFire which believes that the spread of violence mimics the spread of infectious diseases and so the treatment should be similar: go after the most infected and stop the infection at its source. The singular mission of the "Violence Interrupters" - who have credibility on the streets because of their own personal histories -- is to intervene in conflicts before they explode into violence. In The Interrupters Ameena Matthews whose father is Jeff Fort one of the city's most notorious gang leaders was herself a drug ring enforcer. But having children and finding solace in her Muslim faith pulled her off the streets and grounded her. In the wake of Derrion Albert's death Ameena becomes a close confidante to his mother and helps her through her grieving. Ameena who is known among her colleagues for her fearlessness befriends a feisty teenaged girl who reminds her of herself at that age. The film follows that friendship over the course of many months as Ameena tries to nudge the troubled girl in the right direction. Cobe Williams scarred by his father's murder was in and out of prison until he had had enough. His family - particularly a young son - helped him find his footing. Cobe disarms others with his humor and his general good nature. His most challenging moment comes when he has to confront a man so bent on revenge that Cobe has to pat him down to make sure he's put away his gun. Like Ameena he gets deeply involved in the lives of those he encounters including a teenaged boy just out of prison and a young man from his old neighborhood who's squatting in a foreclosed home. Eddie Bocanegra is haunted by a murder he committed when he was seventeen. His CeaseFire work is a part of his repentance for what he did. Eddie is most deeply disturbed by the aftereffects of the violence on children and so he spends much of his time working with younger kids in an effort to both keep them off the streets and to get support to those who need it - including a 16-year-old girl whose brother died in her arms. Soulful and empathic Eddie who learned to paint in prison teaches art to children trying to warn them of the debilitating trauma experienced by those touched by the violence. The Interrupters follows Ameena Cobe and Eddie as they go about their work and while doing so reveals their own inspired journeys of hope and redemption. The film attempts to make sense of what CeaseFire's Tio Hardiman calls simply "the madness".

Autonomy within the company allows Burry to do largely as he pleases so Burry proceeds to bet against the housing market with the banks who are more than happy to accept his proposal for something that has never happened in American history. The banks believe that Burry is a crackpot and therefore are confident in that they will win the deal. Jared Vennett with Deutschebank gets wind of what Burry is doing and as an investor believes he too can cash in on Burry's beliefs. An errant telephone call to FrontPoint Partners gets this information into the hands of Mark Baum an idealist who is fed up with the corruption in the financial industry. Baum and his associates who work at an arms length under Morgan Stanley decide to join forces with Vennett despite not totally trusting him. In addition to Burry's information they further believe that most of the mortgages are overrated by the bond agencies with the banks collating all the sub-prime mortgages under AAA packages. Charlie Geller and Jamie Shipley who are minor players in a $30 million start-up garage company called Brownfield get a hold of Vennett's prospectus on the matter. Wanting in on the action but not having the official clout to play they decide to call an old "friend" retired investment banker Ben Rickert to help out.

That latter aspect may not sit well with Baum. Some of these assumptions may be incorrect and may be far more manipulative than they could have ever imagined which in turn may throw curves into the process.
